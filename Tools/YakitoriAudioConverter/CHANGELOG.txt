- All of the conversion settings are saved to ini file. Settings will be carried over to the next startup.
- If you install FFmpeg, you can convert from general video formats (avi, flv, mpg, mp4, etc.). Not tested so much, the success of the conversion depends on the specifications of FFmpeg, but it has been good conversion in my stock of the video files (flv, wmv, mp4). Please specify additional arguments when there is a problem.
- (Bug fix) Fix "No such file or directory" error on external commands when there is a continuous space in the file name.
- (Bug fix) Improvement at the UI language switching.

** Versiojn 1.1 (2016/2/2)
- Mod name was changed to "Yakitori Audio Converter" from "Yet Another Audio Converter". Because I noticed that the other tool of the same name exists in the world, so in order to avoid misunderstanding. When I thought about next naming, I was just eating yakitori, so I had named this.
- Additional percentage options of the list of the sound volume. You can adjust a little more finely sound volume.
- Additional text boxes to specify the additional argument for LAME and FFmpeg. If you have knowledge of the command argument, you can free to add additional argument to LAME and FFmpeg. In FFmpeg, two kinds of additional arguments can be specified. "Additional arg." is argument for the (FFmpeg's) input file, "Additional arg. 2" is argument for the (FFmpeg's) output file. Please be aware of the proper use of two additional arguments.

** Versiojn 1.0.1 (2016/2/1)
- When the conversion using the FFmpeg, you can change sound volume.

** Versiojn 1.0 (2016/2/1)
