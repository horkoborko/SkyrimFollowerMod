# SkyrimFollowerMod
This project is for the development of a Skyrim Legendary Edition
follower mod called Swims-With-Fishes (SWF), an Argonian mage.

The goal is to first implement him as a default NPC needing only Skyrim
and all of the DLCs to function. Eventually, he is going to feature a
custom voice and have further customization from various beast race mods and
RaceMenu. I am considering trying a custom quest, but that is not a priority
for this particular project.


Tentative Roadmap


1.3


	-Relocate SWF from Abandoned Prison to somewhere along the Sea of Ghosts (Tamriel 15,30?),
	add camping static world objects there (see Tamriel 20,26 for inspiration).
	
	
	-Change outfit to rags
	
	
	-Change his "default" dialogue responses to be more unique
	
	
	-Formulate a very basic script for VA
	
	
1.4


	-Finalize voice and implement first voice files
	
	
	-(Assuming permissions are given) Recustomize SWF with:
	
	
		*RaceMenu
		
		
		*Argonian Fins (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55707)
		
		
		*Install water spells from mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66919) and reconfigure known spells list
	
	
	-Add more dialogue (reminiscent of Kaidan/Inigo/Lucien, see their .esp files)
	
	
More roadmap objectives will be added as I progress through creating the mod.
