# SkyrimFollowerMod
This project is for the development of a Skyrim Legendary Edition
follower mod called Swims-With-Fishes, an Argonian mage.

The goal is to first implement him as a default NPC needing only Skyrim
and all of the DLCs to function. Eventually, he is going to feature a
custom voice and have further customization from various beast race mods and
RaceMenu. I am considering trying a custom quest, but that is not a priority
for this particular project.
