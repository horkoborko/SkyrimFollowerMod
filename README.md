# SkyrimFollowerMod
This project is for the development of a Skyrim Legendary Edition
follower mod called Swims-With-Fishes (SWF), an Argonian mage.

The goal is to first implement him as a default NPC needing only Skyrim
and all of the DLCs to function. Eventually, he is going to feature a
custom voice and have further customization from various beast race mods and
RaceMenu, as well as other features that will make him distinct from the
standard Skyrim followers.


Tentative Roadmap

Pre-Release 1.3

	-Change his "default" dialogue responses to be more unique~
		=DONE: See change below.
		
	-Formulate a very basic script for VA
		=DONE: VA found, basic script for vanilla follower framework complete, with exception to commands.
		
	-Finalize voice and implement first voice files
		=DONE: Voice actor found, first voice lines implemented for basic-most framework.
		
	-(Assuming permissions are given) Recustomize SWF with:
		*Argonian Fins (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55707)
			=DONE: Permission granted, section of mod directly copied to SWF.esp, eliminating dependency.
			
		*Install water spells from mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66919) and reconfigure known spells list
		
	-Add more dialogue (reminiscent of Kaidan/Inigo/Lucien, see their .esp files) as opportunity to tell backstory & say other things.
	
	-Relocate SWF from Abandoned Prison to somewhere along the Sea of Ghosts (Tamriel 15,30?), add camping static world objects there (see Tamriel 20,26 for inspiration)
		=DONE: SWF relocated to a camp by the large, dungeon island between Dawnstar and Winterhold.
		
	-Give fish mechanic (gives slaughterfish steak/oysters for food, smaller fish for alchemy regeants)
	
	-Change outfit to rags
		=DONE: Outfit changed.
	
	
	
More roadmap objectives will be added as I progress through creating the mod.

Other features I want to add in the future: Romance path, quest(s), passive commentary (quests, locations), battle expletives, interaction with NPCs/custom followers
